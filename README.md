# Hypothyroidism Prediction Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing the development of a deep learning model for predicting hypothyroidism. The project is an assignment for a class test and utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which is based on the thyroid disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Repository Contents

- `.gitignore`: A file specifying untracked files to ignore.
- `Hypothyroidism_Prediction_Using_Deep_Learning.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook created using Colaboratory that contains the deep learning model and analysis.
- `hypothyroid.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the deep learning model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaky1206/hypothyroidism-prediction-deep-learning.git
```

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Google Colab to open the .ipynb file.
