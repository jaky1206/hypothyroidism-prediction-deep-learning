Thyroid activities are affected by thyroid diseases. The thyroid gland releases two thyroid hormones called triiodothyronine (T3), levothyroxine (T4), and a peptide hormone called calcitonin. Thyroid hormones affect the rate of protein metabolism and synthesis. In children, thyroid hormones affect growth and development. There are five general types of thyroid disease, each with its own symptoms. One or more different types of thyroid disease can occur at the same time. The main factor affecting the amount of T3 and T4 hormones produced is iodine, as it is the main building block of these hormones. An overactive thyroid gland that produces too many of these hormones causes hyperthyroidism, while an underactive thyroid gland that doesn't produce enough of these hormones causes hypothyroidism. Thyroid disease can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are easily confused with other conditions. When thyroid disease is caught early, treatment can control the disorder even before symptoms appear. The correct interpretation of thyroid function data is an important issue in the diagnosis of thyroid disease. This study aims to diagnose thyroid disease and classify thyroid disease into three categories: hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and normal. The thyroid dataset was obtained from the UCI machine learning archive (University of California-Irvine).
